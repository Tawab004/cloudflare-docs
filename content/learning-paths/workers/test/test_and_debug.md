## Local development and logs

You explored writing tests in the [Get started guide](/workers/get-started/guide/). Now, you will learn how to locally develop and log your Worker.

### Local development

[Local development and testing](/workers/observability/local-development-and-testing/) - Test your Worker locally with `wrangler dev`.

### Logs

[Log from Workers](/workers/observability/log-from-workers/) - Debug your Worker by accessing logs and exceptions through the Cloudflare dashboard or `wrangler tail`.

### Additional resources

To explore more observability, debugging and test options for Workers, refer to [Observability](/workers/observability/) in the Workers documentation.
