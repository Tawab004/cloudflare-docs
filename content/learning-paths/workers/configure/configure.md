## Routing, Cron Triggers and deployments

After creating your first Worker, explore available features.

### Routing

Set your Worker to run on a specific path by reading which configuration option is right for you in [Routes and domains](/workers/configuration/routing/).

### Cron Triggers

Configure your Worker to run on a schedule with [Cron Triggers](/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/).

### Deployments

Review your deployments and rollback to a previous version of your Worker with [Deployments](/workers/configuration/deployments/).

### Related resources

*  Find other configuration options and features available to your Worker under [Configuration](/workers/configuration/) in the Workers developer documentation.
